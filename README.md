## Getting Started

This is a flutter Todo application, which uses `Hivedb` NoSQL database , which featuring *lightweight* and *blazingly fast performance*.

Hive DB can be used for almost any app , where relational database is not required. The boxes store data using key,value pair. 

The Hive DB requires `adapters`which can be autogenerated by build_runner (in our case for `Todo.dart` file) using the following command

`` flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs ``

> Hive Box represents your data collection

For more information about Hive visit the [Repository](https://github.com/hivedb/hive)

> Do not forget to run ``pub get``
